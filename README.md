The `spatial.statistics` houses the code for a Shiny Application aimed
at teaching spatial statistics while providing an easy user interface
for working with spatial data. The field of spatial statistics is still
quite new, and many packages all require different formats of data. Here
we attempt to integrate the three branches of spatial statistics in a
user friendly, educational way.

## App Access

Currently the app is still under construction! Check back in a couple of
months for details on live access.

## References

I learned the material present in the app in a spatial statistics class
I took at UCI from [Veronica
